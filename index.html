          <h3>User research</h3>
          <p>
            User research involves gathering insights and understanding the
            behaviors, needs, and motivations of users through various methods
            like interviews, surveys, and observations. It serves as the
            foundation for designing user-centric products by providing critical
            data to inform design decisions.

          <h3>User experience</h3>
          <p>
            User Experience (UX) focuses on enhancing user satisfaction by
            improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the
            interaction with a product. It encompasses all aspects of the
            end-user's interaction, including the interface, graphics,
            industrial design, physical interaction, and manual.

          <h3>User interface design</h3>
          <p>
            User Interface (UI) design is the process of creating interfaces in
            software or computerized devices with a focus on looks or style. The
            goal is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as
            possible, through elements like buttons, icons, and other visual
            elements.
